### Overview

This is a Shadowrun RPG character manager. Years ago I created an AD&D character manager (see my Memorbelia repo) and thought 
I could create something similar for my Shadowrun games. As always, it tends to extend further and further.

### Progress

I need to review the code to align with the new coding requirements I've set for myself. Some are probably already here 
as I continue to learn as I create and maintain various sites. They're documented in the Inventory wiki just FYI.

### Installation

In the 'install' directory is a mysql.sql file. This is all the tables that are used by the system.

There should also be a data file. This file contains various commands and information needed in order to have the site start 
up properly. Eventually I'll have an installation script. Eventually.

In addition, there is a settings.php file that is linked into each subdirectory off of the root directory of the site. 
You'll need to update that to add the necessary values for accessing mysql on your server.

### Data

The data is taken from the 1st Edition on up through 6th. I've added bits in order to accommodate various differences in 
the different systems, in part because I want to see if some gear has been there from the beginning and what the price 
changes might be (and other stats).

Anyway, keep an eye here as I get the system working. Since I use it for my games, it should be reasonably accurate. 
Some things just can't be added. I'm mainly looking to add things that a character might need to know/see.
